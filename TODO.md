TODO
* ~~Health/Hunger-based effects~~
* ~~Make the client use the server's config value for sprinting~~
* ~~\[the above worked fine\]Possibly make the sprint logic server side~~
* ~~Sleeping effects~~
* Allow effects in config be allied to both hunger and health if desired without needing to add effect twice. Making for a smaller cleaner config and eaiser configuration process.
* Make sleep buffs only apply if you are over a configurable ammount of hunger when sleeping
